## Laravel Payroll System (Current: Laravel 5.8.*)

### Introduction
---
The Laravel Payroll System gives you a huge head start on any web application of any sort. It comes with a full-featured access control system that is simple to use right out of the box. I put a lot of effort into it, and I hope it will be useful to you and save you time!
